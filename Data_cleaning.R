# Questions
# 1) Do variables StartDate, EndDate, Status, Progress, Duration, Finished, RecordedDate, Distributionchannel stays in the cleaned version?
# 2) We have some people above 70 years of age. Should we set a limit or leave everybody? The oldest person is 110
d %>% filter(Dem_age > 70) %>% ggplot(aes (x = Dem_age)) + geom_histogram()
# 3) Should we reode "- other" in Country to NA?
# 4) What is with number 5 in Dem_martial?



# Log:
# 1) I removed all participants that were below 18 for the cleaned version
# 2) I removed all participants that did not their consent for the cleaned version
# 3) In Brunei from 3894 people, 3887 speak Bulgarian (probably Bulgarians), 6 speak English, 1 speaks LT
d %>% filter(Country == "Bulgaria") %>% group_by(UserLanguage) %>% summarize(n())
# I recoded all people from Brunei who speak Bulgarian to Bulgaria
# 4) Detected that there's "-other" option in country
# Recoded "- other" to NA
